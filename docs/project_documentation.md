# Embedded Data Logger Project Documentation

## Overview
This project demonstrates a data logger that reads from sensors, logs the data, and sends it to a host system for visualization and further analysis.

## Components
- **DHT22 Sensor**: For temperature and humidity measurements.
- **Arduino**: Used as the microcontroller platform for this project.

## Workflow
1. Sensor data is read and logged by the microcontroller.
2. Data is sent over a serial connection to the host.
3. Host logs and visualizes data in real-time.
